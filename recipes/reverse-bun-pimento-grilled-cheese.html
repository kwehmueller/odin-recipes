    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is, in its first part, the Blue Ribbon Pimento Cheese that opens up <a href="https://www.southernfoodways.org/publication/southern-foodways-alliance-community-cookbook/">The Southern Foodways Alliance Community Cookbook</a>. Credit goes to Nan Davis and her aunt Ella, as well as book editors, Sara Roahen and John T. Edge. I won't include Lella's mayonnaise recipe; for that, I encourage you to buy the book. Without it, in Lella's words, "you might as well not bother."</p>
    <p>The second part is a little homegrown gluttony. No credit required.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Part 1: the cheese</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Pimentos</li>
        <li>Lella's mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Onion powder</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Worcester suace</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Part 2: the sandwiches</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>Burger buns</li>
        <li>Arugla</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Ham</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Grate 5 cups of <em>cheddar cheese</em> </strong> and load into a food processor. <strong>Drain and add a 4 oz. jar of whole <em>pimentos</em></strong>, and then pulse until they are finely chopped.</li>
        <li><strong>Add &frac12; cup of <em>Lella's mayonnaise</em> into the processor</strong> and then pulse to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Add your dry ingredients</strong>--&frac14; tsp of <em>onion powder</em>, an equal amount of <em>cayenne pepper</em>, and a pinch of <em>sugar</em>--<strong>as well as &frac14; tsp of <em>Worcester sauce</em></strong>, and then pulse the mixture until it's a smooth, solid colored consistency.</li>
        <li>If your mixture is a little too dry, <strong>add up to another &frac12; cup of <em>Lella's mayonnaise</em></strong> and pulse until smooth.</li>
        <li>Grab your burger buns, preferably a brioche, pretzel, or sourdough.Spread a little <em>butter</em> on the inside of the buns, and then flip.<strong>On the outside of the buns, spread a healthy layer of the <em>pimento cheese</em>.</strong><em></em></li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the sandwich layer by layer</strong>. I like to start with <em>pickles</em>, then <em>arugla</em>, <em>ham</em>, <em>tomato</em> and then top with the second bun, buttered side (the inside of the bun) facing out.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat a pan or a panini press to medium low</strong>, hot enough to get the cheese melted but not burn the buns.</li>
        <li>Toast until the cheese is melted and the bun is a nice golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve with chips, and a little grace for yourself.</li>
    </ol>
