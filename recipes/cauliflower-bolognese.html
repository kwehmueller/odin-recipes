    <h1>Cauliflower Bolognese</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the first of several easy, make-ahead slow cooker recipes I tried from a infographic found on Reddit. Credit goes to the <a href="https://www.titlemax.com/discovery-center/home-and-family/15-make-ahead-freezer-bag-recipes/">creators</a>, but deviations from that guide are my own.</p>
    <p>This recipe is almost <em>too</em> easy. As in, it suffers from a case of "well if that's really it, I guess that's it." There are simple things you can do to amplify this sauce and make it really something. If you follow the guide to a T, you'll end up with a watery disappointment. On the first attempt, I neglected to smash the cauliflower to pieces and ended up with soggy vegeables over noodles.</p>
    <p>No good.</p>
    <p>Play around with it, and you'll have an extremely satisfying vegetarian pasta night. This one rewards improvisation.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li>Diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetable stock</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Red onion</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Cauliflower</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Parmesean cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Measure out your dry ingredients.</strong>To a freezer bag, add 2 tsp. of <em>oregano</em>; chiffonade and add 1 tsp. of <em>basil</em> to the bag (reserve a few whole leaves for garnish); add a good helping of <em>salt</em>, <em>pepper</em>, and <em>red pepper flakes</em> to taste (at least 1 tsp. of each).</li>
        <li><strong>Add a 28 oz. can of <em>diced tomatoes</em> to the freezer bag.</strong> If preferred, small dice at least 4 fresh tomatoes, and add a small can (about 4-6 oz.) of <em>tomato sauce</em> to the bag.</li>
        <li><strong>Mince 2 cloves of <em>garlic</em>.</strong>Add the garlic, at least 1 tsp., more to taste, to the freezer bag.</li>
        <li><strong>Dice a medium <em>red onion</em></strong>, enough to generate &frac34 cup. </li>
        <li><strong>Cube 1 head of <em>cauliflower</em></strong>into bite-sized chunks. Place into the freezer bag.</li>
        <li><strong>Add &frac12 cup of <em>vegetable stock</em> to the bag</strong>. Toss the bag to mix the ingredients well. Either dump the contents right into the slow cookder and cook on high for 3 &frac12 hours, or store in the freezer with the bag upright until you're ready to cook.</li>
        <li><strong>Near the end of its cooking time, prep your choice of noodles.</strong> The recipe source included <em>zucchini noodles</em> as an option, but I think this works better with a thick <em>angel hair pasta</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>While the noodles cook, smash up the <em>cauliflower</em> </strong>to break up the florets.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain the noodles, return to the pot, and add your bolognese right to the noodles</strong>. At this stage, you can either serve as is or add a thickening agent while the sauce cooks down a bit further. Top with freshly grated <em>parmesean cheese</em>, garnish with a few whole leaves of <em>basil</em>--however you like it, enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
