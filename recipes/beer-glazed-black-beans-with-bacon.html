    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the notable modifications to Mark Bittman's recipe in <em><a href="http://www.howtocookeverything.com/">How to Cook Everything</a></em>, this one has been completely devoured at every single cookout I've attended for the better part of a decade.</p>>
    <p>This is an amazing, flavorful dish to have in the back of your mind, especially on a budget. It's easy to put together, and each ingredident aside from your choice of beer and the optional bacon can reach your cabinet for under a dollar.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Yellow onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Beer</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Black beans</li>
        <li>Chili powder</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Place 6-8 oz. of <em>bacon</em> on a cool, non-stick skillet.</strong>Heat to medium-high. Cook until until finished on one side--about 5 minutes--flip, and then cook most of the way through on the second side. Transfer to a cutting board, roughly chop, and then set aside. Reserve the bacon grease in the skillet for the next step.</li>
        <li><strong>Chop or dice the <em>onion</em> and add to the hot skillet.</strong> Cook until soft, stirring occasionally. </li>
        <li><strong>Add 1 tbsp. of minced <em>garlic</em></strong> and cook for about a minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Add 8 oz. of <em>beer</em></strong>, your choice. Lagers and wheat beers are pretty mellow, but still shine through. Darker beers will make the dish <em>very</em> rich.</li>
        <li><strong>Add 3 cups (24 oz.) of <em>black beans</em>, drained but still moist.</strong> Stir in with the beer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add 1 tbsp. of <em>chili powder</em>, 1 tbsp. of <em>honey</em>, and a healthy sprinkle of <em>salt</em> and <em>pepper</em>.</strong> Give the mix a good stir, and then let the heat bring it to a steady bubble.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook for about 10 minutes, and then add the partially cooked <em>bacon</em>.</strong>Then, cook for another 5 minutes, making sure the bacon is cooked all the way through.</li>
        <li>When the mixture is reduced, <strong>taste and adjust the seasoning to your preference.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Serve hot,</strong> and enjoy with the rest of the beer you used for the recipe.</li>
